# gnome-terminal-popup
Bash script to show Gnome terminal window(s) on current desktop. 
This could be used as a native alternative to drop down terminals on Gnome desktop environment.

# How to use it
This script can be bound to keyboard shortcut. In such way the Gnome terminal window can be accessed anytime and anywhere within the Linux system. 

Obviously it can be also exeucted manually.

# Planned additional features
- **toggle visibility:** if Gnome terminal is already visible then executing this script should hide it and another way around if is not.
